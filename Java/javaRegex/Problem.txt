Write a class called MyRegex which will contain a string pattern. 
You need to write a regular expression and assign it to the pattern
such that it can be used to validate an IP address. 
Use the following definition of an IP address:

IP address is a string in the form "A.B.C.D", 
where the value of A, B, C, and D may range from 0 to 255. 
Leading zeros are allowed. 
The length of A, B, C, or D can't be greater than 3.
