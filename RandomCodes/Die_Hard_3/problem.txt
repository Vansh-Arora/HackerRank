Simon: On the fountain, there should be 2 jugs - a 5 gallon and a 3 gallon. Do you see them? Fill one of the jugs with exactly 4 gallons of water and place it on the scale and the timer will stop. You must be precise; one ounce more or less will result in detonation. If you’re still alive in 5 minutes, we’ll speak. 
Bruce: Wait, wait a second. I don’t get it. Do you get it? 
Samuel: No. 
Bruce: Get the jugs. Obviously, we can’t ﬁll the 3 gallon jug with 4 gallons of water. 
Samuel: Obviously. 
Bruce: All right. I know, here we go. We ﬁll the 3 gallon jug exactly to the top, right? 
Samuel: Uh huh. 
Bruce: Okay, now we pour this 3 gallons into the 5 gallon jug, giving us exactly 3 gallons in the 5 gallon jug, right? 
Samuel: Right, then what? 
Bruce: We take the 3 gallon jug and ﬁll it a third of the way... 
Samuel: No! He said, “Be precise.” Exactly 4 gallons. 
Bruce: Damn! Every cop within 50 miles is running his ass off and I’m out here playing a kids' games in the park. 
Samuel: Hey, you want to focus on the problem at hand? 
Given 2 jugs of capacity a and b gallons, and an infinite supply of water, can you fill one of the jugs with exactly c gallons of water ? 
Input Format
First line contains the number of testcases T. T lines follow. 
Each line contains 3 space separated integers a, b and c . a and b indicate the capacity of the two jugs respectively, and c denotes the exact capacity with which one of the jugs should be filled. 
Output Format
For each test case, print "YES" (in a new line) if one of the jugs can be filled with exactly c gallons of water and "NO" (in a new line) if they cannot be filled. ( quotes are for clarity )
Constraints
1 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 103 
1 ≤ T ≤ 100
Sample Input
2
5 3 4
3 6 4
Sample Output
YES
NO
Explanation
Bruce can do the following, fill jug a with 5 gallons. 
a = 5, b = 0
Now, he can fill jug b with 3 gallons from jug a.
